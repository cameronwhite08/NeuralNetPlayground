# NeuralNetPlayground

This started out as in in-class project in my school's Artificial Intelligence class CS4242. The goal was to create an implementation of a neural network that would be able to detect handwritten letters from the MNIST dataset.

This project serves as a place for me to mess aeound with, and learn about Neural networks

### Current Work
- Training a neural net to play TicTacToe with data provided from MiniMax perfect player

### Future Plans
 - Create RNN (Recurrent neural network)
